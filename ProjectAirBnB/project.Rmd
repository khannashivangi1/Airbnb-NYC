### Airbnb-NYC Data

This dataset contains all information about hosts, availability, room types for the Airbnbs in New York City. 

###### Reading data in files

```{r}
airbnb <- read.csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv")
```

###### Structure of dataframe

```{r}
str(airbnb)
```

##### Here is what the following column names represent:

From the structure output, we see that id and host_id are treated as int values rather than factors. So we will convert them into factor values.
```{r}
airbnb$id <- as.factor(airbnb$id)
airbnb$host_id <- as.factor(airbnb$host_id)
```

To check if any of the entries has been repeated,
```{r}
unique_id <- unique(airbnb$id)
if (length(unique_id) == length(airbnb$id)) {
  print("No duplicate entries")
} else {
  print("Duplicate entries found")
}
```


We will now find out what neighbourhoods and room types are listed in this dataframe, and how they are distributed.

```{r}
summary(airbnb$neighbourhood_group)
summary(airbnb$room_type)
```

* We see that there are more airbnbs in Brooklyn and Manhattan as compared to the other areas.  
* We also notice that the number of shared rooms is significantly less in comparison to other room types.

New York is divided into 5 main neighbourhood groups.

Let's take a look at the data specifically from different neighbourhood groups:  

#### Manhattan
```{r}
manhattan_airbnb <- airbnb[which(airbnb$neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan"),]
manhattan_table <- table(manhattan_airbnb$room_type)
manhattan_table
barplot(manhattan_table, main = "Manhattan Room Types", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of properties", col = "Pink", ylim = c(0, 14000))
```

#### Brooklyn
```{r}
brooklyn_airbnb <- airbnb[which(airbnb$neighbourhood_group == "Brooklyn"),]
brooklyn_table <- table(brooklyn_airbnb$room_type)
brooklyn_table
barplot(brooklyn_table, main = "Brooklyn Room Types", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of properties", col = "Blue", ylim = c(0, 12000))
```

#### Queens
```{r}
queens_airbnb <- airbnb[which(airbnb$neighbourhood_group == "Queens"),]
queens_table <- table(queens_airbnb$room_type)
queens_table
barplot(queens_table, main = "Queens Room Types", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of properties", col = "Red", ylim = c(0, 4000))
```

#### Bronx
```{r}
bronx_airbnb <- airbnb[which(airbnb$neighbourhood_group == "Bronx"),]
bronx_table <- table(bronx_airbnb$room_type)
bronx_table
barplot(bronx_table, main = "Bronx Room Types", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of properties", col = "blueviolet", ylim = c(0, 800))
```

#### Staten Island
```{r}
staten_airbnb <- airbnb[which(airbnb$neighbourhood_group == "Staten Island"),]
staten_table <- table(staten_airbnb$room_type)
staten_table
barplot(staten_table, main = "Staten Island Room Types", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of properties", col = "Yellow", ylim = c(0, 200))
```

For a better comparitive view, we can view it together,
```{r}
counts <- table(airbnb$room_type, airbnb$neighbourhood_group)
barplot(counts, main = "Room type distribution in different neighbourhoods", xlab = "Room Type", ylab = "Number of Rentals", col = c("blue", "red", "yellow"), legend = rownames(counts), beside = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 14000))
```

After having a look at all these results, we can conclude the following:  

* The percentage of entire homes/apartments available for rent in a particular neighbourhood is the greatest in Manhattan.
* The percentage of private rooms available for rent in a particular neighbourhood is the greatest in Queens and Bronx. 

***

Now, let's compare the prices across different neighbourhood groups, and room types.

```{r}
avg_price_neighbourhood <- tapply(airbnb$price, airbnb$neighbourhood_group, mean)
barplot(sort(avg_price_neighbourhood), main = "Average price", xlab = "Neighbourhood", ylab = "Mean price of rental", col = "Coral", ylim = c(0, 250))
avg_price_roomtype <- tapply(airbnb$price, airbnb$room_type, mean)
barplot(sort(avg_price_roomtype), main = "Average price", xlab = "Neighbourhood", ylab = "Mean price of rental", col = "seagreen3", ylim = c(0, 250))
```

The average rental price in manhattan is the highest in Manhattan. It is almost twice the average rental price in Bronx, which is the lowest.  
This probably has connection to the fact that the number of entire home/apartment rentals are greater in Manhattan, which have higher prices.

***

Are the number of reviews dependent on the neighbourhood of the rental property? Let's find out.

```{r}
review_neighbour <- tapply(airbnb$number_of_reviews ,airbnb$neighbourhood_group, sum)
barplot(sort(review_neighbour), xlab = "Neighbourhood", ylab = "Number of reviews", col = "tan2",  ylim = c(0, 500000))
```

The answer to the above question is well evident. There is a relation, but there can be bias as the number of rentals from each neighbourhood is not equal. To get a clearer answer we need to collect data with an equal distributuion, which is next to impossible, because we cannot ask Airbnb to start new rentals or close some of the existing ones.
